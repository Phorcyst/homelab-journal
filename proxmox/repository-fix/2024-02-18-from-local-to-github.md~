## The Journey So Far

### Phase 1: Local Documentation (What I Already Did)
Earlier, I created local documentation files to track my progress:
~/documentations
# Created local notes directory
mkdir -p ~/documentation/proxmox
mkdir -p ~/documentation/troubleshooting

# Wrote down the repository fix steps while troubleshooting
nano ~/proxmox-setup-notes.txt
nano ~/documentation/troubleshooting/401-unauthorized-error.txt

### Phase 2: Setting Up GitHub (Today)

Now I'm moving those local notes to GitHub for better organization and portfolio value:

#Created GitHub repository: homeLab-journal

#Set up SSH key for authentication

#Cloned the repository to my Proxmox server

#Now organizing my local notes into this structure
