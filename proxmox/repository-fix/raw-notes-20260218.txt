PROXMOX SETUP NOTES - 18/2/2026

What I did:
1. Finally decided to fix the apt update
2. Got 401 Unauthorized errors for enterprise repos

What I learned:
- Proxmox defaults to enterprise repos that need a subscription
- For home lab, I need to switch to no-subscription repo
- The error messages pointed to https://enterprise.proxmox.com

Commands I ran:
apt update  (this failed)

Files I checked:
ls -la /etc/apt/sources.list.d/
cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pve-enterprise.sources

How I fixed it:
1. nano /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pve-enterprise.sources
   - Added # to comment out all lines

2. nano /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ceph.sources  
   - Added # to comment out all lines

3. Created new file: nano /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pve-no-subscription.sources
   - Added:
     Types: deb
     URIs: http://download.proxmox.com/debian/pve
     Suites: trixie
     Components: pve-no-subscription

4. Ran 'apt update' again - SUCCESS! No more errors.

Current status:
- apt update works
- 40 packages can be upgraded
- Ready to create LXC container

Next steps:
1. Run 'apt upgrade' to update packages
2. Create Ubuntu container for NotebookLM
